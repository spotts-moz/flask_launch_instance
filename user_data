# TODO:
# - Add more checks around command completion and success ( no faith based runs ) 
# - Sending mail needs to be worked out on data run completion or error
# - Evaluate deployment tools other than straight to AWS commands and user-data
# - Add logging facilities and possibly web hook triggers
